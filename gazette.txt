A new poll shows that with three weeks to go before the election, 38 per cent of Quebecers could still change their minds on who they will vote for.

And more than four voters in 10 (44 per cent) say the upcoming televised leadership debates might influence their vote, a piece of data that will only increase the pressure on the leaders of the four main parties as they prepare to square off under the lights.

On the other hand, 49 per cent say the debates won't influence their vote.

With 21 days to go before the vote, the findings are included in a new Léger poll produced for the Montreal Gazette and Le Devoir. The full results of the poll are to be published Tuesday.

But the poll reveals that well into the campaign, the mood in Quebec is still volatile with many voters hedging their bets.

A first French debate sponsored by Radio-Canada between Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard, Coaltion Avenir Québec Leader François Legault, Parti Québecois Leader Jean-François Lisée and Québec solidaire spokesperson Manon Massé takes place this Thursday.

A second debate, this one in English, takes place a few days later, on Monday, Sept. 17.

The Léger poll also reveals one person in two (52 per cent) intend to watch the French debate. Thirty-one per cent say they won't. More older Quebecers (55 and up) will watch the debate.

The internet poll was conducted from Sept. 7-10 and is based on a sample of 1,014 Quebecers
