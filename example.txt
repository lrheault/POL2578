Mr. Speaker, clearly, specific services for veterans that have been overlooked or depleted in the previous government need to be spoken to again; revisiting the veterans offices that were closed, and quite frankly, stopping the process of taking them to court all the time as they seek to be treated properly by a government that owes them a debt of service. 
However, when I speak about housing as a solution to challenges, the jobs in the housing sector are jobs that returning service personnel are often trained for. When we talk about delivering affordable housing, many of the veterans who have financial challenges as a result of injuries they have sustained benefit from those sorts of programs. Therefore, we may not hear the word “veterans” in front of the program, and they may not be described in particular as we describe the program, but they are part of a group of Canadians who need our support. The infrastructure programs not only promise jobs but services to those individuals. 
That is part of a comprehensive approach to make sure that the veterans who have served this country are served by this government.
